# Basic Usage

## Copy files

::: tip Note

If you want to automate the process, then use one of the [translation managers](installation/managers.md).
:::

After adding the dependency using composer (as described above) to your application you can find the language files under the directory `vendor/laravel-lang/lang`.

Copy the folders of languages that you want, in `resources/lang` or `lang` directory of your Laravel application.
